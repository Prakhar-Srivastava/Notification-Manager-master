			‚ùù<em>You like because of, but you love despite of.</em>‚ùû <br />
			This can't be more true in our case, desipte all of my fallacies and short-commings you keep loving me the same if not more, all these times I would think that I was a person unworthy of anyone's love yet believed that I will love the other person with all of my heart and probably even more than she'd love me, but you proved me wrong both ways, not only you showered me with your true love but also overwhelmed with the ways and resilience. My heart was open but for the first time it found another and even more caring. And now you heart is the closest it lives to.

			Of course babe, how could I ever forget your birthday, from what I have learnt from you this relationship is new in many ways, this is the first time you've trusted someone to this level and it's new because now your heart, more than ever knows that this ain't gonna break, and about the things we share you can now tell anyone that "Prakhar knows me inside out", and all the things we do together they all are new to you, like this year, welcome to the new you Cutie, Sweetie, Milybar, Twiggy, Gummy, Lola bunny, Fairy, Baby. I lovely you the most.
